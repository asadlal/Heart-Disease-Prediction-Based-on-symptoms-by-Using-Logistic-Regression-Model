# Heart Health Prediction based on Symptoms by Using Logistic Regression Model

This repository contains the implementation code for a logistic regression model used for predicting heart health based on symptoms.

## Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. In this project, we developed a logistic regression model to predict heart health based on a set of symptoms. The model was trained on a dataset containing information about various symptoms and corresponding heart health status.

## Implementation
The implementation code is provided in the Jupyter Notebook file [Heart Health Prediction based on Symptoms by Using Logistic Regression Model.ipynb](Heart%20Health%20Prediction%20based%20on%20Symptoms%20by%20Using%20Logistic%20Regression%20Model.ipynb). This notebook contains the Python code used for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asadlal/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Based-on-symptoms-by-Using-Logistic-Regression-Model
    ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd Heart-Disease-Prediction-Based-on-symptoms-by-Using-Logistic-Regression-Model
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file Heart Health Prediction based on Symptoms by Using Logistic Regression Model.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell and train the logistic regression model.
5 .Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset and analyze the results.
